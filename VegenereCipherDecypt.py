#Decryption is performed by going to the row in the table corresponding to the key, finding the position of the ciphertext letter in this row,
#and then using the columnâ€™s label as the plaintext.For example, in row A (from AYUSH), the ciphertext G appears in column G,which is the first
#plaintext letter.Next we go to row Y (from AYUSH), locate the ciphertext C which is found in column E, thus E is the second plaintext letter.
